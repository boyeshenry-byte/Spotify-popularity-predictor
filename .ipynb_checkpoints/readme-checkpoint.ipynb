    "## Musical Feature Modeling: Feature engineering and predictive analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and predictive analysis of highly dimensional song attributes; emphasizing model selection, regularization and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was performed as part of a graduate level data science course through the University of Pittsburgh. While the dataset and objectives were provided, all preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling decisions, and analysis were independently designed and implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting song popularity from audio features is a deliberately difficult problem. Musical attributes are highly correlated and capture only part of what drives popularity. This project focuses less on maximizing predictive performance and more on demonstrating principled feature engineering, model comparison, and decision making under modeling constraints skills directly transferable to real world applied data science problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of musical attributes describing song characteristics, can we build a predictive model that accurately estimates the target outcome while managing multicollinearity and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contained 32,833 observations and 22 features. The target variable was track_popularity. This dataset contained many correlated features, motivating the need for regularization and feature selection. This dataset contained many duplicate tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods and Modeling Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature Selection\n",
    "    * Selected a subset of 16 features\n",
    "    * Dropped duplicate tracks to prevent bias\n",
    "* Missing Values\n",
    "    * The missing values of this dataset were dropped through the above feature selection steps. As such, they were not an issue for this project\n",
    "* Feature Scaling and Standardization\n",
    "    * Right skewed continuous inputs were handled via log transforming them to reduce skew. This was also done to the target variable\n",
    "    * All features were standardized using scikit-learn's StandardScaler prior to modeling\n",
    "* Design Matrices\n",
    "    * Predictors were specified using a symbolic formula interface, which was used to create a formula ready matrix. This ensured consistency in encoding features, inclusion of an intercept and compatibility across models used.\n",
    "* Model Selection and Evaluation\n",
    "    * To evaluate the tradeoff between model complexity and predictive performance, a sequence of increasingly expressive linear model specifications was explored. Models were constructed using a formula based interface, allowing systematic comparison of baseline, additive, interaction, and nonlinear feature augmented formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "      An intercept only model was used at baseline to establish baseline performance. Additive models were then fit using categorical predictors, continuous predictors, and then their additive combination. This provided a benchmark into capturing any marginal contributions of different feature groups\n",
    "\n",
    "      To capture any potential feature dependencies, interactions were introduced. Pairwise interactions were introduced for the continuous input features as well as models allowing for the combinations of continuous and categorical interactions while maintaining linear main effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "      In addition, models with non-linear terms were included to allow for modest departures from linearity, without abandoning linear modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Models were evaluated using cross-validation metrics. Preference was given to models that maintained parsimony while improving predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation to assess generalization to unseen data. While higher-complexity models achieved stronger performance on the training set, cross-validation revealed substantial overfitting in these specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best cross-validated performance was achieved by a feature-rich model incorporating interaction and derived terms. However, a substantially simpler additive linear model performed nearly as well on held-out data, with overlapping confidence intervals. Given this negligible performance difference, the additive model was selected as the preferred specification due to its greater parsimony and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected model includes 46 regression coefficients and achieves an average cross-validated R² of approximately 0.074. While modest, this performance consistently outperforms the intercept-only baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of model coefficients suggests:\n",
    "* Energy is negatively associated with song popularity\n",
    "* Danceability is positively associated with song popularity\n",
    "* Genre contributes to differences in predicted popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the low explained variance indicates that linear combinations of available musical features capture limited predictive signal. This suggests that important drivers of popularity—such as artist recognition, marketing exposure, and platform-specific recommendation mechanisms—are not represented in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis highlights the practical limitations of modeling popularity using audio features alone. While music features capture aspects of audio characteristics, they do not represent every driver of song characteristics. Things like artist recognition, marketing, and social media trends are not captured within this analysis, but have influence over song popularity. As such, even the best performing models only explain a portion of the variations in song popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several correlated variables in this dataset that limit the effectiveness of standard linear models. Though this was mitigated through regularization and feature selection, there may be some residual multicolinearity affecting model stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this modeling approach focused primarily on linear relationships with limited non-linear augmentation. While this was done to preserve interpretability, it may fail to capture more complex interactions present in real-world dynamics. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Several extensions could improve predictive performance and provide additional insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regularized high capacity models - Applying elastic net regularization to higher-order interaction models could balance expressive power while controlling overfitting.\n",
    "* Alternative problem formulations - Exploring the dataset as a classification task by binning the popularity could align with practical use cases.\n",
    "* Non-linear modeling approaches - Tree based models, SVM or ensemble methods could better capture complex features not accessible to linear models.\n",
    "* Feature enrichment - Incorporating external metadata such as artist level features or platform engagement metrics could improve predictive signal.\n",
    "* Stability and diagnostics - Additional diagnostics such as variance inflation factor analysis or feature stability assessment across multiple resamples could further refine model robustness.\n",
    "\n",
